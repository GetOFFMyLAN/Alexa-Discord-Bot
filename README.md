# Alexa-Discord-Bot
This is my personal Discord bot for my server modelled after my Discord Christmas Bot. This bot is not intended for multiple servers.

## Issues:
- Note this bot may crash unexpectedly
- There are multiple issues with the music player including: number of skips message not appearing, songs from the queue not loading after a song ends, etc
- If you find additional issues, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/GetOFFMyLAN/Alexa-Discord-Bot/issues)
